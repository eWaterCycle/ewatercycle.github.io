# eWaterCycle II

Understanding water movement on a global scale is essential for society
to predict floods, droughts and the effect of land use on water balance.
However, large scale hydrology is difficult because, from a hydrological
point of view, every field, every street, and every part of the world is
unique. We are able to understand and describe how water moves in these
locations at a local scale, but due to the extreme spatial variability
it is difficult to capture such processes at a global scale. We call
this the curse of locality.

On top of this, existing hydrological models exist in a huge variety of
programming languages, standards etc. which limits their re-usability
and reproducibility. In the eWaterCycle II project, we are developing
a framework in which hydrological modellers can work together in a
collaborative environment.
