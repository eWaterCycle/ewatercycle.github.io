Understanding water movement on a global scale is essential for society 
to predict floods, droughts and the effect of landuse on water balance. 
However, large scale hydrology is difficult because from a hydrological 
point of view, every field, every street, and every part of the world is 
unique. We are able to understand and describe how water moves in these 
locations at a small scale, but due to the extreme spatial variability 
it is difficult to capture such processes at a global scale. We call 
this the curse of locality.

On top of this, existing hydrological models exist in a huge variety of 
programming languages, standards etc. which limits their re-useability
and reproducibility.

In the eWaterCycle II project, we are developing a framework in which 
hydrological modellers can work together in a collaborative environment. 
In this enviroment, they can, for example, easily;
* Combine models and data independent of programming languages.
* Compare models to other models of the same area.
* Perform data assimilation to improve model accuracy.
* Reproduce the results obtained by their peers.

Additionally, we are actively involving the global community of hydrologists 
through our OpenHYDRO platform to;
* Ensure our platform meets the needs of the scientific community.
* Organize community challenges to explore underrepresented research areas.

The final goal of the eWatercycle II project is to enable the collaborative 
development of a global hydrological model through the combination of the 
existing local models. In our collaborative environment hydrologists can upload
and analyze their models and contribute to the greater goal of a community 
built and shared global hydrological model.

To to show what we envision for the environment and collect feedback on our 
efforts at every turn, we have prepared a "Minimum Viable Product" demo above.
