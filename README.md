# eWaterCycle II Project Website

The eWaterCycle II project envisions a collaborative environment containing 
many local and global hydrological models, allowing hydrologists to run 
experiments on high performance computing infrastructure, with multiple 
models, without having to be an expert in computer science. This will all 
contribute to further advance our knowledge of the global hydrological 
cycle.
