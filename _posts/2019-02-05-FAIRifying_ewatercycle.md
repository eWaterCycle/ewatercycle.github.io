# FAIRifying eWaterCycle
## Towards reproducible science and better flooding forecasts

Growing populations, economies, industries and urbanization are increasing the
demand for water, while extreme weather spurred by climate change is projected
to lead to major changes in water availability. With more and more people moving
into delta areas, more and more people become vulnerable to flooding. Naturally
this increases the demand for flood forecasts. If we know that a flood is likely
to happen in 10 days time, is there still something we can do to prevent this
flood from actually happening? Can we take preparations to mitigate the effect
of the flood?

This was exactly the aim of the [eWaterCycle project](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/project/ewatercycle):
to predict flood and drought events 10 days in advance, worldwide and at unprecedentedly
high resolution.


### Reproducibility

While the complex system created in the
[eWaterCycle project](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/project/ewatercycle)
worked for us, it was extremely difficult for someone else to set up such a
system on their own computing resources, let alone to go back, rerun and
validate our experiments. This is where the
[FAIR — Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability ](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)
— principles come in,
to serve as a guide around these issues, thereby maximizing the added value of
the research. It is important to note that these principles not only apply to
‘data’ in the conventional sense, but also to how this data came to be. The
issues identified by the FAIR principles are precisely the ones we tried to
solve in the
[FAIRifying eWaterCycle project](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/project/fairifying-ewatercycle)[^1].

In this project we created a fully reproducible (low resolution) version of the
eWaterCycle forecast. The lessons learned will be taken into account moving
forward in developing a community multi-model environment for hydrological
experiments and analyses in the follow up project
[eWaterCycle II](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/project/ewatercycle-ii),
but will also benefit
the design of the European Open Science Cloud for Research.

In our effort to FAIRify the system, we relied heavily on both
[docker](https://www.docker.com/) containerization and the [Common Workflow
Language (CWL)](https://www.commonwl.org/). Containerization provides a solution
to the problem of how to get software to run reliably when moved from one
computing environment to another. CWL is a specification for describing analysis
workflows and tools in a way that makes them portable and scalable across a
variety of software and hardware environments, from workstations to cluster,
cloud, and high performance computing (HPC) environments. In addition, CWL is
able to provide provenance through
[CWLProv](https://zenodo.org/record/1966881#.XFMIj-2CrJE). Workflow provenance
saves information about the workflow specification, input and outputs, and
executions of the workflow, so that experiments can be verified and reproduced
in a precise manner.

It is technically very hard to connect CWL workflow steps in a cyclic manner.
Cyclic workflows are much better controlled using a specialized workflow engine
for cycling systems. We therefore opted to only describe the workflow steps in
CWL and control the workflow using such a workflow engine. Here we used Cylc: a
workflow engine that orchestrates distributed suites of interdependent cycling
tasks that may continue to run indefinitely. Cylc was originally developed for
operational environmental forecasting. Having its roots in environmental
forecasting, Cylc provides handy features for these kind of operational
forecasts such as clock triggers, event triggers, retry handlers for individual
tasks, and more. This allows us for example to wait for input data to be
available on the server, retry specific tasks when they failed, or choose
alternative paths of the workflow. Technical overview FAIRified eWaterCycle

In essence, the forecast system (picture above) performs a couple of steps that
are executed every day:

* Downloading of input data from various sources
* Pre-processing of input data
* Performing data-assimilation and running an ensemble of hydrological forecasts
* Post-processing of model output
* Uploading of the results and provenance to the archive

### Results
Using a combination of the CWL standard for workflows, Cylc as a workflow
engine, and Docker software containers, we were able to create a fully
reproducible (low resolution) version of the eWaterCycle forecast. Output is
stored at OneData and made available for analysis in a notebook environment. In
addition the hydrological forecasts are visualized in a
[web application](http://forecast.ewatercycle.org/). The forecast is running daily
now, without any manual intervention and runs on supercomputers without changes
needed to the software installed on the system. Interactive forecast

During this project we learned some valuable lessons that we plan to integrate
into our larger [eWaterCycle II project](https://www.ewatercycle.org/), with a
focus on FAIR hydrological modelling. Some of the lessons learned during this
small project include:

* You cannot build a FAIR system build on un-FAIR components. Sometimes you have
  no control on e.g. the FAIRness of your input data.
* Improving FAIRness of datasets from third parties is very difficult without
  involving the original author of such data. Involving authors of these
  datasets is often not feasible within the scope of small projects.
* Metadata and licensing information for datasets is often unclear or sometimes
  non-existent.
* The [OneData system](https://onedata.org/#/home) is a really nice concept, but
  could be further improved by adding some key usability features like file
  sharing, persistent storage with identifiers, authentication and authorization
  services and execution services for standards-based workflows.
