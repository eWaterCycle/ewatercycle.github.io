Understanding water movement on a global scale is essential for society
to predict floods, droughts and the effect of land use on water balance.
However, large scale hydrology is difficult because from a hydrological
point of view, every field, every street, and every part of the world is
unique. We are able to understand and describe how water moves in these
locations at a local scale, but due to the extreme spatial variability
it is difficult to capture such processes at a global scale. We call
this the curse of locality.

On top of this, hydrological models exist in a huge variety of
programming languages, standards etc. which limits their re-usability
and reproducibility.

In the eWaterCycle project, we are developing a framework in which
hydrological modelers can work together in a collaborative environment.
In this environment, they can, for example, easily:
* Combine models and data independently of programming languages,
* Compare models to other models of the same area,
* Perform data assimilation to improve model accuracy,
* Reproduce the results obtained by their peers.

Additionally, we are actively involving the global community of hydrologists
through our OpenHYDRO platform to:
* Ensure our platform meets the needs of the scientific community,
* Organize community challenges to explore underrepresented research areas.

The final goal of the eWaterCycle project is to enable the collaborative
development of a global hydrological model through the combination of the
existing local models. In our collaborative environment hydrologists can upload
and analyze their models and contribute to the greater goal of a community
built and shared global hydrological model.

To show what we envision for the environment and to collect feedback on our
efforts at every turn, we have prepared a "Minimum Viable Product" demo above.
